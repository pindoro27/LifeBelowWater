 **Reduce local threats**:
   - **Minimize pollution**: Implement waste management programs (reduce single-use plastics, improve sewage treatment) to prevent pollution from reaching the reefs.
   - **Promote sustainable fishing practices**: Establish and enforce no-take zones, promote alternative livelihoods (e.g., ecotourism, seaweed farming), and educate fishers on sustainable fishing methods.
   - **Control coastal development**: Advocate for and implement responsible coastal development plans that minimize impacts on reefs.

 **Empower local communities**:
   - **Raise awareness**: Conduct educational campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of coral reefs and the threats they face.
   - **Build capacity**: Train local community members in reef monitoring, restoration techniques, and sustainable tourism practices.
   - **Generate income**: Support local businesses that promote sustainable tourism and marine conservation (e.g., eco-lodges, dive operators).
